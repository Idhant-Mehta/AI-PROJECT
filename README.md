# Zomato Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Zomato's restaurant dataset to uncover insights about restaurant trends, customer preferences, and factors influencing ratings. The analysis involves data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical evaluation of various attributes in the dataset.

---

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Explore patterns in categorical and numerical variables.
- Identify relationships between key features like location, cuisines, cost, and ratings.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on findings.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following features:
- **Restaurant Name**: Name of the restaurant.
- **Location**: Area where the restaurant is located.
- **Cuisines**: Type(s) of cuisines served.
- **Cost for Two**: Approximate cost for two people.
- **Ratings**: Average customer rating.
- **Other Attributes**: Additional details like online delivery, dining options, and more.

## Steps in the Analysis

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values.
- Remove duplicates.
- Convert data types where necessary.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzing individual features.
  - Example: Distribution of ratings, cost for two.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Analyzing relationships between two features.
  - Example: Relationship between cost and ratings.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Identifying interactions between multiple variables.
  - Example: Ratings of restaurants based on location and cuisine.

### 3. Visualization
- Use bar charts, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps for better insights.

### 4. Insights and Recommendations
- Summarize findings and suggest actionable steps for stakeholders.
